            </h3>
            <span class="about__text__description">
              The RCF Development team has over 100 years of combined experience in real estate, private equity and technology.  RCF Development was created 14 years ago with the goal of building and protecting wealth.  Since then we have been the largest investor in over $50 Million of commercial real estate projects.
              <span class="about__text__list__header">
                We believe that the keys to our success are focus, discipline and transparency:
              </span>
              <ul class="about__text__list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Focus –</strong> Our portfolio consists of multifamily projects of 4-10 units in the Mid-Wilshire area of Los Angeles.  This focus has led to an ability to deliver exceptional returns for all stakeholders through a mastery of every project detail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Discipline –</strong> We have built a vertically integrated organization that manages all aspects of each investment.  From deal structure to design and development to property management, our team takes a disciplined approach to every decision.  This translates to a greater ability to deliver projects on-time and on-budget.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Transparency –</strong> The foundation of all of our investment partnerships is the proposition that everyone wins when there are no hidden fees, confusing deal structures or complex deals outside of our area of excellence.  We focus on building properties that people want to live in; our returns are the result of real value creation, not financial machinations.
                </li>
              </ul>
